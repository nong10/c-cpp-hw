# Homework of c and c++ of 2019 fall Jacobs (Partial)

### Discription
This repository contains all codes that I wrote for partial c and c++ assignments of 2019 fall. 
If you have better solutions or find any errors, please contact me. 
I would like to maintain this repository.

### Disclaimer
This repository was intended to share the source code of previous homework, to help
people understand c and c++, and to share ideas of solutions to those assignments
(I believe that ideas are to be learned, even to be copied, although assignments are required to be done individually.)
Since the goal is to SHARE ideas on those assignments, I do not guarantee that 
all solutions are either correct or implemented using the described methods in assignments. 
But, if you come up with better solutions or find out any error, please contact me. 
I would like to maintain this repository.
